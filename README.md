## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Tools**: Gradle, Git, Postman
- **Testing**: JUnit

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- MongoDB
- Gradle
- Git

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amit130391/Coder-Hack.git
   cd Coder-Hack
2. Configure MongoDB:
   Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or update the connection details in application.properties if using a remote MongoDB instance.
3. Build and run the application:
   ./gradlew clean build
   ./gradlew bootRun

## Usage
1. The application runs on http://localhost:8080.
2. Use the API endpoints to manage users and their scores.
3. Use Postman or any other API client to interact with the endpoints.

## API Endpoints
### User Endpoints
1. GET /users - Retrieve a list of all registered users.
2. GET /users/{userId} - Retrieve the details of a specific user.
3. POST /users - Register a new user to the contest.
        Request Body: { "userId": "string", "username": "string" }
4. PUT /users/{userId} - Update the score of a specific user.
        Request Param: score
5. DELETE /users/{userId} - Deregister a specific user from the contest.

## Validation and Error Handling
1. User ID: Must be unique.
2. Username: Must be provided.
3. Score: Must be between 0 and 100.
4. Badges: Automatically assigned based on score thresholds.
        1 <= Score < 30 -> Code Ninja
        30 <= Score < 60 -> Code Champ
        60 <= Score <= 100 -> Code Master
5. Error Codes:
    404 Not Found: User not found.
    400 Bad Request: Validation errors or invalid input.
    500 Internal Server Error: Server errors.
